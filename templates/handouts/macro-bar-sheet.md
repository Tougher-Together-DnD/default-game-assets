# MacroBar Character Sheet

Create a character sheet. Under its *Attributes and Abilities*  tab add macros.

When doing nested macros, be sure to reference other macros in the same character sheet as ~Macro-Name. As opposed to #Macro-Name for game-wide accessible macros stored under the *Collections* (![][Collection Icon]) tab.

Edit the character sheet by adding the appropriate users in the "In Player's Journal" and "Can Be Edited and Controlled By" fields. This does not have to be done for the GM, as they have permissions to all assets.

### Free VTTES Move
This technique can be used for free, even with games that have different owners, just swap the JSON file.

1. Using the [Firefox][Firefox-URL] addon, [VTTES Enhancement Suite][VTTES Enhancement Suite-URL] a DM can export macros under *Collections* (![][Collection Icon]) as a JSON file.

2. In the new game create a character to hold your macros. Using VTTES go to the "Export & Overwrite" tab, there Overwrite the new character with your JSON file. 

### Character Vault Move
If the owner of the game does not have a Roll20 subscription, their game will have limited vault access.

1. From the Campaign Page, under "Game Settings" they can set *Allow players to import their own Characters?* to "Yes".
1. Then a subscribed player can import the Macro Character as they do for any vault characters.

### Transmogrifier Move
And finally, the easiest most intuitive way is with the transmogrifier. This only works if you create both games.
