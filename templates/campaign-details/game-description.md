## Game Play Details
*Specifics of Game mechanics*

### The Group
Looking for party of 3 to 6 players.

### The Campaign
%%GENRE%% taking the Characters from level 1-%%LEVEL%% (%%MAX-LEVEL%% max).

### Software Used
Discord is used for voice chat.
DnDBeyond for Character Sheets.
Roll20 for Maps and Session gameplay.

### Character Creation

#### Sources:
Official Content.

#### Other allowed options:
* Backgrounds:
* Equipment:
* Misc:

#### At Dungeon Master's Discretion:
I want the player to have as much freedom and imagination in crafting an engaging character. However, for the sake of balance and preparation, discuss with me before doing the following:

* %%STUFF%% The player should consult with DM before using.
* %%BANNED%% Stuff like flying races or Unearthed Arcana banned from being used (Some DM's ban that).
  
#### House Rules:
* Drinking a health potion is a bonus action, administering to another player is an action.
* When you start making death saving throws, you also gain a level of exhaustion. (Consider it a concussion from going unconcious.)
* Flanking an enemy with an Ally (or hostile to target) directly opposite of you, melee attacks get +2 to hit.
* Shooting prone grant range weapon attacks +2 to hit.
* DM Inspiration Pool is a running total of inspiration charges earned. They can be used in 1 of three ways:
  * You can expend one or more charges of DM Inspiration Pool to add +1 per charge expended to any roll of dice you make.
  * You can expend one charge of DM Inspiration Pool to infuse a health potion to heal for max amount.
  * You can expend one charge of DM Inspiration Pool per spell level to cause a healing spell you cast to heal for max amount.

## Sessions
* We are all here to have fun. If something is bothering you, for any reason, please speak with me (the DM). I want to hear from you.
* Be courteous to other players by showing up on time.
* Include everyone in on the fun. We can accomplish this, by of course, the obligatory refraining from hate speech and abuse.
* This is an ***Adult Game***, but be considerate and respectful others in language and topics.
* Each session is %%SESSION-LENGTH%% hours.

## Payment
A payment of $%%AMOUNT%% is expected before the beginning of each weekly session.
Session 0 (zero) is free, as the players and DM get to know each other!

**Why should you pay?**  
Paying for games provides a distinct incentive for both the DM and players to consistently be on time and ready to play each session. It also helps offset the time and money the DM spends preparing for the sessions. I want to provide you the the best player experience I can.

**Disclaimer:**
*This game will require payment to the Game Master at a rate of $%%AMOUNT%% per session, paid 1 hours in advance via PayPal. Roll20 is not responsible for any payment transactions and cannot enforce any private arrangements.*
