#### **House Rules and Gameplay Mechanics**

We use the following house rules to keep gameplay flowing smoothly, while giving players room for creative and tactical decisions:

##### **Initiative Turn Order**
After every **combat** and **rest** players will **roll for initiative** to establish their **"around the table" turn order**. This turn order stays in place during combat encounters, keeping gameplay fast and strategic. NPCs and monsters follow preset initiatives based on their role in the encounter:

- **Boss NPCs**: Act at initiative 20 to emphasize their dominance.  
- **Home Field Advantage**: Creatures in lairs or favored environments act at 15.  
- **Mini-Bosses/Shot Callers**: Act at initiative 11, commanding their minions.  
- **Party Sidekicks**: Act at initiative 2, supporting the heroes.  
- **Minions**: Act at initiative 1.  
- **Jump Start Reaction**: Players can use their **reaction** to act first in the round. If multiple players choose this, their original initiative decides who goes first.  
- **Pass Turn**: If unsure, you may pass your turn and act before the next NPC.  
- **Surprise Round**: Ambushers act first without using their reaction. Surprised creatures lose their reaction for the round.

This system keeps combat structured, adds tactical depth, and allows for dynamic responses.

##### **Natural 20 on Initiative**
Rolling a **natural 20** on your initiative allows you to **choose your position** in the turn order. You can act immediately before or after another player of your choice, giving you an early tactical advantage.

##### **Inspiration Pool**
Instead of standard Inspiration, when awarded by the DM, you will gain **1 Inspiration Point** to store and use at your discretion. On your turn, you can spend these points to **adjust your roll** by 1 per point spent, either increasing or decreasing the roll result. This gives you more control over when and how you use your Inspiration, turning it into a valuable strategic resource.

##### **Exhaustion After 0 HP**
If you are reduced to **0 hit points** and then restored, you immediately gain **1 level of exhaustion**. This reflects the physical toll of being brought back from the brink of death and adds tension to future battles.

##### **Ranged Attacks While Prone**
You gain **+2 to Ranged Weapon Attack Rolls** with ranged weapons while prone, reflecting the stability of a low firing stance.  

##### **Stealth and Group Checks**
When the party attempts a group stealth check, the **highest and lowest stealth rolls** are averaged to determine the partyâ€™s DC. You must be at least **30 feet away** to roll for individual stealth (unless using special features).

##### **Point Blank Range**
Ranged attacks do not suffer disadvantage if a hostile creature is within 5 feet. max amount.
