## House Rules and Gameplay Mechanics

We use the following house rules to keep gameplay flowing smoothly, while giving players room for creative and tactical decisions:

![Horizontal Ruler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tougher-Together-DnD/default-game-assets/refs/heads/main/templates/branding-images/standard/horizontal-ruler.png)

### Initiative Turn Order

After every **combat** and **rest** players will **roll for initiative** to establish their **"around the table" turn order**. This turn order stays in place during combat encounters, keeping gameplay fast and strategic. NPCs and monsters follow preset initiatives based on their role in the encounter:

- **Boss NPCs**: Act at initiative 20 to emphasize their dominance.  
- **Home Field Advantage**: Creatures in lairs or favored environments act at 15.  
- **Mini-Bosses/Shot Callers**: Act at initiative 11, commanding their minions.  
- **Party Sidekicks**: Act at initiative 2, supporting the heroes.  
- **Minions**: Act at initiative 1.  
- **Jump Start Reaction**: Players can use their **reaction** to act first in the round. If multiple players choose this, their original initiative decides who goes first.  
- **Pass Turn**: If unsure, you may pass your turn and act before the next NPC.  
- **Surprise Round**: Ambushers act first without using their reaction. Surprised creatures lose their reaction for the round.

This system keeps combat structured, adds tactical depth, and allows for dynamic responses.

#### Natural 20 on Initiative
Rolling a **natural 20** on your initiative allows you to **choose your position** in the turn order. You can act immediately before or after another player of your choice, giving you an early tactical advantage.

#### Familiars and Summons

Familiars and other such Summons=ed creatures take their turn on the player turn. They do not have their own initiative.

### Inspiration Pool

Instead of standard Inspiration, when awarded by the DM, you will gain **1 Inspiration Point** to store and use at your discretion. On your turn, you can spend these points to **adjust your roll** by 1 per point spent, either increasing or decreasing the roll result. This gives you more control over when and how you use your Inspiration, turning it into a valuable strategic resource.

### Stealth and Group Checks
When the party attempts a group stealth check, the **highest and lowest stealth rolls** are averaged to determine the party’s DC. You must be at least **30 feet away** to roll for individual stealth (unless using special features).

### Exhaustion After 0 HP
If you are reduced to **0 hit points** and then restored, you immediately gain **1 level of exhaustion**. This reflects the physical toll of being brought back from the brink of death and adds tension to future battles.

### Ranged Weapon Attacks While Prone
You gain **+2 to Ranged Weapon Attack Rolls** with ranged weapons while prone, reflecting the stability of a low firing stance.  

### Ranged Weapon Attacks Point Blank Range
Ranged weapon attacks do not suffer disadvantage if a hostile creature is within 5 feet.

### Modified Weapon Mastery

These are modifications of the 2024 Weapon Mastery Properties for each weapon. All Martial weapons have mastery properties

A Character can perform one of the additional effects if they are proficient with a weapon.

*Note: Characters can draw or stow one weapon each time they attack as part of the Attack action, allowing for strategic weapon switching during combat. A Player could draw and attack, next turn attack and stow, third turn draw and attack with different weapon. Alternatively a character can drop a weapon without expending an Interact with Object free action.*

```
Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You gain proficiency with four weapons of your choice. Each one must be a simple or a martial weapon.

```

### Expend Half Movement to Perform Bonus Actions

In our game, certain actions that traditionally require a bonus action or an action instead cost **Half Movement Speed**. This rule allows for more dynamic combat and smoother interactions without sacrificing a character’s primary actions.

1. **Commanding Companions**:
   - Giving a verbal command to a familiar, summoned creature, or ranger’s beast companion.
   - Examples:
     - Instructing a familiar to deliver a spell.
     - Ordering a beast companion to attack or disengage.

2. **Manipulating Items**:
   - Drinking a potion (for yourself).
   - Tossing an item to an ally.
   - Switching weapons when hands are full.
   - Drawing or stowing a weapon or item.
   - Donning or doffing a shield.

This house rule shifts focus from bonus actions, giving characters more flexibility in combat while reinforcing strategic movement management.
