## About

Common Sign Language is a practical visual language originally developed by individuals with hearing impairments. Over time, it has been adopted by rogues, marines, and other military professionals to communicate silently in situations requiring stealth or precision. CSL is simple to learn but offers a surprising depth, capable of conveying complex ideas through hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language.

### Sound

CSL relies on the silent elegance of movement, with each gesture crafted to express meaning clearly. Facial expressions add nuance, allowing practitioners to communicate tone and intent effortlessly. In battle or shadowed alleys, CSL has proven invaluable, enabling swift, silent coordination.

### Script

Though CSL has no formal written system, users often sketch diagrams or adapt Common letters to describe key signs. These written aids are used mainly for teaching or recording, while the true strength of CSL lies in its dynamic, in-person delivery.
