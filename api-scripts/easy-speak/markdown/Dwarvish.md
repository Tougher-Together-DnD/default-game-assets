## About

Dwarvish (or Dwarven) was the name for a family of languages used by dwarves. The dwarves called their own language Dethek, but most other races used that term to refer to the runic alphabet in which the language was written.

Although a verbally dying language by 1400 DR, Dwarvish was still found all over Faerûn inscribed into weapons, buildings and mystical items.

The language followed dwarves all over Faerûn and beyond, making it an extremely widespread language. Communities and races that had been separated for some time evolved their own dialects. 

### Sound

Dwarvish has similar grammatical constructs to Common. This was no doubt due to the fact that both languages evolved alongside one another. These shared rules mean that speakers of Common have found it relatively easy to learn and translate Dwarvish.

The vocabulary of which tend to be short, low syllable words. More than two syllables is rare, when they occur the inflection is on the second syllable.

### Script

All Dwarvish languages use a runic script known as Dethek. Dethek runes are rarely written on paper or cloth due to the short life and fragile nature of such materials. Runes are usually carved or scraped into stone or metal, be it the walls of a building or the blade of a sword.
