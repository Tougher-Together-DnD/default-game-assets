## About

The giant language, called Jotun by those who speak it, was the ancient language of most giants. It was one of the oldest active languages. Giant was derived from the Primordial language. Jotunstein had strong Auld Dwarven influences, and the Thorass language, by extent Common, of Faerûn are thought to share lingual roots with Jotun, possibly having evolved from an even more ancient giant language.

### Sound

Giant follows a Subject-Verb-Object order. The copula, *er* is often dropped. The rest of its grammar, conjugation, sounds, and even words are very similar to Common or Thorass.

### Script

Both ancient and modern Giant is written with Dethek runes. Ancient giants also had a set of logographic runes primarily used for runecasting, although they were also used symbolically in art to represent or refer to related giant subraces and gods. These runes did not make up a true alphabet or syllabary, but rather they were diagrams or models of the relationships between cosmic forces and the deeper truths of the universe
