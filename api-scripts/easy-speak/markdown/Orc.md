## About

Orc, also known as Orcish or Daraktan, was the common language written and spoken by most orcs.

### Sound

Daraktan is spoken in terse short syllable sounds pushed from the lips as if spitting the words out. It can be tiring to speak for most humans as the words require large longs and lengths of exhaled force. It is however quite easy to learn as the vocabulary is small with very distinct words. Due to the difference in inflections the language is quite easy to understand when screamed across a battlefield or harsh weather. 

### Script

Daraktan used the Dethek script.
