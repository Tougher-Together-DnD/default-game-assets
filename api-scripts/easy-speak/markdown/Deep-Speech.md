## About

Deep Speech is the language of aberrations, unnatural creatures with bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, or an alien mindset. Creatures like the Mind Flayers, Aboleths, and Elder Brains. Deep Speech is an alien for of communication with patterns contrary to human thought, originating from the Far Realm.

Aberrations of the Far Realm are telepathic. As such Deep Speech is akin to body language. Motions, sounds, and smells more to create an environment for the receiver, that becomes context for the transmitted thought.

Mental thoughts accompany transcribed Deep Speech no matter the script. The telepathic energies infuse with the work when produced. As such many who learn Deep Speech eventually go mad.

### Sound

It is an extremely complex highly contextual language, reliant heavily on more than just sound, but also tone and inflection. It utilizes body language, smells, trilling, gurgling, and a whole manner of unpleasantness that most mortals struggle with performing. Though better achieved by mortal races that have gills.

These things are easier with aberrant morphologies like multiple mouths, tentacles, and anatomies capable of producing sounds unachievable by most mortals.

Fiends have an easier time learning Deep Speech.

### Script
Deep Speech has no native script of its own. Most aberrations in Toril live in the Underdark, due to proximity and frequent encounters with drow, the language is often recorded in the Espruar script. The Espruar script was developed by the moon elves, and subsequently adopted by sun elves, drow, and other elven peoples as their preferred script.
