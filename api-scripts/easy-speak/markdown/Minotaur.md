## About

Minotaurs were a strong and combative race of monstrous humanoids resembling bull–human hybrids that were rare in Faerun. Many minotaurs worshiped the demon lord Baphomet and were not allowed in many cities because of this known factor. Most moved toward the chaotic evil alignment, and did not work well in groups, packs, or even parties due to their solo hunter-like nature.

Minotaurs were carnivores, but preferred the taste of human flesh. They loved to dwell within maze-like caverns or ruins, where their innate sense of direction prevented them from getting lost. They lured travelers into their maze-like homes, where the minotaurs had the advantage over their unfortunate prey.[citation needed]

Many minotaurs couldn't be trusted with non-minotaur races at times, since most humanoids were their meal, and they would do anything for a quick bite out of a sleeping party member, slave owner, or wandering villager. They were not welcomed in any cities, and received an immediate death sentence, or a stoning if caught. Or worse, they were hunted by multiple hunters seeking the thrill of giving the beasts a taste of their own medicine.

### Sound

A minotaur’s voice is a deep, resonant blend of guttural tones and sharp, rolling consonants, evoking the sound of an ancient, melodic language steeped in history. Their speech is rhythmic, with each word carrying a natural cadence that feels almost ceremonial. Vowels are drawn out and rich, often rising and falling like a chant echoing through a stone temple, while the consonants strike sharply, reminiscent of the clatter of hoofbeats on stone.

The fluidity of their speech contrasts with its force, as syllables flow together seamlessly yet land with deliberate weight. Words are shaped by their broad tongues and deep chests, giving their speech a layered, almost harmonic quality that feels both ancient and mysterious. The tone is both commanding and unfamiliar, invoking images of labyrinthine corridors and primal wisdom.

When angered or in the heat of battle, their voices crescendo into powerful bellows and sharp, nasal snorts that ripple with the intensity of raw emotion. These sounds, combined with guttural huffs and low, drawn-out roars, create an unsettling blend of the melodic and the feral. To hear a minotaur speak is to encounter a voice that carries the weight of myth and the force of untamed nature, a sound as captivating as it is intimidating.
