## About

Loxodon tend to use giant names, although it is not uncommon for words of Orc or Dwarvish script to find their way into the language. Due to some races' difficulty at pronouncing their guttural names, highly social Loxodon opt instead for a nickname, choosing a defining physical feature to go by, mainly revolving around their trunks or tusks. The Loxodon do not use last names, instead going by their leader's name with the suffix -clan or -herd when it becomes necessary.

### Sound

Loxodon is composed of ear piercing trumpets, grunts so low the ground vibrates for feet, and everything within that range.
