## About

The insectile Kraul lurk in the tunnels below street level. Many are loyal to the Golgari Swarm, but others follow their own esoteric caste system.

While they can not speak Common, some do do understand it.

### Sound

The Kraul use wing flaps, pheromones, the ultrasonic vibrations of chitin rubbed against chitin. 

### Script

Kraul work in highly organized hives. Each one born with the knowledge it needs to perform its role. As such there is little importance on written records.
