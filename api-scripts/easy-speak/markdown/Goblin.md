## About

The goblin language, also known as Ghukliak, was the language spoken by goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears

### Sound

The use of shrills, hard consonants, mumbled, and growls give Goblin an animal like quality. Goblin vocabulary is often very small, repetition serves to heighten the meaning of things. "Booyahg" means magic. And all goblin magic users have it in their name. Think "Magic Jack" or "Magic -insert name-". But a very powerful magic user wont be a different word like "warlock " or "mage" but just another "booyahg" added to the title.

A lot of hard *k*, rolled *r*, *br* sounds.

### Script

Goblin is written in Dethek, but more recently goblins and hobgoblins have begun using the Thorass script.
