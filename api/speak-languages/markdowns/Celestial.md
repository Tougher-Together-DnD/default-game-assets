## About
The celestial plane is a place of absolute goodness and order. It has heavily influenced the mortal definition of beauty, and by extension wealth, and the language reflects this.

It is difficult to deceive in Celestial. Any attempt to mislead will cause physical pain, typically on the tongue itself. It takes someone very practiced or very determined to tell a blatant falsehood in celestial without wincing.

### Sound
The words of celestial as a language share a repetitive structure that, when combined with proper inflection, sound much akin to a song or poem. A group of angels is referred to as a chorus because of this.

### Script
Angels saw little need for writing before mortality embraced the practice of preserving information. They are immortal, so the preservation of knowledge for future generations was not a driving force in the cultural development of the heavens. When Celestial is recorded in written form it is by mortals or for mortals.

The language is about transmission of intent and purpose. Manuscripts of Celestial oaths and decrees will be accompanied by pictures, this practice forms the basis of illuminated manuscripts. Particularly when written in Common. The Gnomish language is also intricate and deep in its subtlety, therefore the Gnim *Dethek* Script is used when illustration is impractical, such as engravings or limited by space.
