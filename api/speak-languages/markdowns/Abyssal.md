## About
The Abyss was the birth place of the demons, a chaotic evil universe unto itself with uncountable layers of infinite variety connected haphazardly. The Abyss's place in the cosmology of the Forgotten Realms shifted over time, but the nature of the plane remained fairly constant: a violent, malevolent place where the strong survived on the backs of the weak, the weak conspired to overthrow the strong, alliances only lasted while convenient, and the landscape itself tortured the mind and body of all who dared to pass.

The oldest of the demonic races, *obyriths* were ancient creatures of chaos and insanity said to have come from an entirely different reality. They ruled the Abyss for eons and were responsible for creating the tanar'ri, before an ill-fated war broke their armies and a subsequent slave revolt drove most of them into hiding or to extinction. They spoke a primordial language derived from the very nature of their plane. Large parts of this dead language can be seen in Abyssal's evolution. Abyssal at times is considered a dialect of this primordial language.

The most common type of demon is the *tanar'ri*. An evil mortal soul imprisoned in the Abyss, changed and  twisted by the planes nature. The first tanar'ri was **Demogorgon**. Most intelligent creatures of the Abyss can communicate with telepathy, so when a language did emerge it was driven by a need to inspire terror in mortal kind.

### Sound
Abyssal is a harsh language that shares an interesting relationship with mortality. A sentence in abyssal consists of barks, growls and clicks that seem almost a twisted mockery of common. The language is exactly that, a lingering vestige of the demon’s origin twisted by wickedness of the Abyss, and strictly utilized to spread suffering to mortals.

Lower-ranking demons speak using sounds like the barking of canines, while the speech of more refined demons sound like softly droning ocean waves mingled with the violence of angry hornets. As with everything involving the tanar'ri, however, their speech is unpredictable, and sometimes an elite balor's words were rougher or a lowly bar-lgura's words smoother.

The language, influenced by the chaos of the abyss, relies more on context than exact pronunciations or syntax.

### Script
Demons never bothered creating a written language, as such things are a rarity by their very nature. The written form of abyssal was created by mortals seeking to make binding agreements with demonic forces, and is intentionally convoluted to make such dark knowledge easy to keep hidden. Written abyssal is a series of overlapping glyphs, first read from right to left with one set of glyphs, then bottom to top with the other.

Using the *barazhad* alphabet; an etched, flourished, runic system used by most primordial languages.

More commonly written in the Infernal script (which itself is an evolution of barazhad) by mortals seeking pacts or contracts with outsiders (non-elemental creatures whose essence is not from the prime material plane). Infernal is the language of devils, the Blood War enemies of the demons.
