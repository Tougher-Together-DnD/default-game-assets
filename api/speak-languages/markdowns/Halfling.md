## About
The halfling language, which was properly called Luiric (or Lurienal), was a language spoken by the halflings of Luiren. Since halflings were so adaptive by nature, the vast majority of halflings outside of Luiren had abandoned their native tongue and spoke Common or other human languages instead.

Halflings speak their own language, which uses the Common script. They write very little in their own language so unlike dwarves, elves, and gnomes, they don't have a rich body of written work. They halfling oral tradition, however, is very strong. While the Halfling language isn't secret, halflings are loath to share it with others.
