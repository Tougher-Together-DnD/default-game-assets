# D&D 5e: Objects - GM Notes

Objects in Dungeons & Dragons can play a critical role in gameplay, either as part of the environment or as interactive items. This guide summarizes object stats and mechanics for quick reference.

## Object Armor Class (AC)
The AC of an object depends on its material:

| Material         | AC  |
|-------------------|-----|
| Cloth, Paper, Rope | 11  |
| Crystal, Glass, Ice | 13  |
| Wood, Bone         | 15  |
| Stone             | 17  |
| Iron, Steel       | 19  |
| Mithral           | 21  |
| Adamantine        | 23  |

## Object Hit Points (HP)
The HP of an object is based on its size and material:

### **Fragile Objects (e.g., glass, crystal):**
| Size         | HP  |
|--------------|-----|
| Tiny         | 2   |
| Small        | 3   |
| Medium       | 4   |
| Large        | 6   |
| Huge         | 8   |
| Gargantuan   | 10  |

### **Resilient Objects (e.g., wood, stone, metal):**
| Size         | HP  |
|--------------|-----|
| Tiny         | 3d6 |
| Small        | 4d6 |
| Medium       | 5d6 |
| Large        | 6d6 |
| Huge         | 7d6 |
| Gargantuan   | 8d6 |

## Object Damage Threshold
Certain large, resilient objects have a damage threshold, which reduces incoming damage that does not meet the threshold.

| Object Type       | Damage Threshold |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Wooden Door       | 10               |
| Stone Wall        | 15               |
| Iron Chest        | 20               |
| Fortified Structure | 30             |

## Mechanics for Interacting with Objects

### **Breaking Objects**
To break an object, a character can make a Strength check. The DM sets the Difficulty Class (DC) based on the object's properties:

| Object Type         | Example                | DC  |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----|
| Fragile             | Glass window           | 5   |
| Normal              | Wooden door            | 10  |
| Reinforced          | Iron-bound chest       | 15  |
| Strong              | Stone wall             | 20  |
| Magical             | Arcane barrier         | Varies |

## Object Immunities
Objects are immune to the following:
- Poison damage
- Psychic damage
- Strength and Dexterity saving throws
- Conditions such as Charmed, Frightened, or Exhausted

## Example Objects

### **Doors**
| Door Type       | AC  | HP   | Notes                  |
|------------------|-----|------|------------------------|
| Wooden Door      | 15  | 18   | Damage threshold 10    |
| Iron Door        | 19  | 27   | Damage threshold 20    |
| Reinforced Door  | 20  | 30   | May require special tools to bypass |

### **Walls**
| Wall Type        | AC  | HP (per 10 ft.) | Notes               |
|-------------------|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| Wooden Wall       | 15  | 15             | Vulnerable to fire  |
| Stone Wall        | 17  | 30             | Resistant to fire   |
| Iron Wall         | 19  | 45             | Damage threshold 20 |

### Notes for the GM
- Large objects like walls or statues might require multiple attacks to fully destroy.
- Creative solutions (e.g., burning a rope bridge or collapsing a stone ceiling) should be encouraged.
- Use object HP sparingly; sometimes a simple DC check is enough for dramatic storytelling.
