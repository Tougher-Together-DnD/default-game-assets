# Ship and Crew Actions

Ship actions represent the coordinated efforts required to operate a vessel during its turn. To perform any action, whether it's navigating treacherous waters, firing a ballista, raising sails, or engaging in evasive maneuvers, crew members—whether players or NPCs—must fulfill specific roles.

Whether sailing to war or hunting notorious pirates, ships make deadly [Weapons](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Weapons#h-Weapons) and dramatic battlefields. This section provides [Guidance](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Guidance#h-Guidance) on using ships in [Combat](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Combat).

## Initiative

A ship rolls [Initiative](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Designing%20Complex%20Traps#h-Initiative) using its [Dexterity](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Dexterity), and it uses its crew’s quality score as a modifier to that roll.

On a ship’s turn, the captain decides which of the ship’s Actions to use.

**Move.** For Each Movement Component operated, the Ship will have a Speed Unit available during the Ship Phase. Each Speed Unit is a set distance.

**Turn.** When a Helm Component is operated, the Ship will be able to make turns, or evasive maneuvers.

**Attack.** For each Weapon Component manned, the Ship can make an Attack. Refer to the individual Weapon Component for details about the Attack and Targets allowed. Sometimes a weapon is restricted to attacking from a narrow vantage point.

**Grapple.** If you are within 20' of another vessel you can attempt to grapple. The two ships make an opposed Wisdom (Vehicle) check. If you equal or beat your opponent’s check, the two ships are grappled. Ships can elect to automatically fail the contest and willingly be grappled. Grappled ships fall to zero speed.

During the next Ship Phase, your ships will be adjacent to each other (0 ft apart). Enthusiastic boarders can try to swing, swim, or jump the gap between the vessels in the Player Phase before the ships are adjacent.

**Escape a Grapple.** You can attempt to free your ship of a grappling ship and get underway again. The two ships make an opposed Wisdom (Vehicle) check. However, the Ship that initiated a *Grapple* will have advantage.

If you equal or beat your opponent’s check, the escape attempt succeeds. The escaping ship’s speed increases by 10 ft. and is no longer grappled.

## Crashing a Ship

If a ship moves into the space occupied by a creature or an object, the ship might crash. A ship avoids Crashing if the creature or object is at least two sizes smaller than it.

When a ship crashes, it must immediately make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage to its hull based on the size of the creature or object it crashed into, as shown on the Crash Damage table. It also stops moving if the object or creature is one size smaller than it or larger. Otherwise the ship continues moving and the creature or object collided with moves to the nearest unoccupied space that isn’t in the ship’s path. At the DM’s discretion, an object that is forced to move but is fixed in place is instead destroyed.

A creature struck by a ship must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the ship’s Strength modifier, taking damage based on the ship’s size (as shown on the Crash Damage table) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

###### Crash Damage

|    **Size**    | **Bludgeoning Damage** |
| :---: | :---: |
|   Small    |        1d6         |
|   Medium   |        1d10        |
|   Large    |        4d10        |
|    Huge    |        8d10        |
| Gargantuan |       16d10        |

#### Sinking Condition

A ship that has its Hull reduced to 0 or fewer [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) gains the sinking condition. A sinking ship cannot move or [attack](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack), and it takes on water and in 10 rounds after gaining the sinking condition submerges completely underwater. 

Each additional hit on a sinking ship that deals more than 25 points of damage reduces the remaining time for it to submerge by 1 round. 

A ship that sinks becoming completely emerged, drops to the bottom of the body of water and is considered destroyed. A destroyed ship cannot be repaired— it is so significantly damaged it cannot even be used for scrap material. 

Magic can repair a sinking ship if the ship’s [hit points](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) are raised above 0, at which point the ship loses the sinking condition.

In the case of Air Ships a falling condition arises if its engines are reduced to 0 HP. A ship that is falling, falls until it strikes the ground, 1 round for every 100 feet in altitude.

Generally, nonmagical repairs take too long to save a ship from sinking once it begins to go down.

## Crew Members

![img_center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tougher-Together-Gaming/default-game-assets/refs/heads/main/handouts/quick-reference/images/ship-actions-crew.png)

A ship requires a number of able-bodied sailors to crew it, as specified in its stat block. A crew’s skill, experience, morale, and health are defined by its quality score. This score can affect a number of general ship activities, like the crew’s ability to notice threats or contend with Hazards. A crew starts with a quality score of +4, but that score varies over time, going as low as −10 and as high as +10. It decreases as a crew takes casualties, suffers hardship, or endures poor health. It increases if the crew enjoys high morale, has good health care, and receives fair leadership.

The Quality of the Crew adds a bonus to some actions and features. Most ships have a base Initiative of 10. The Quality of the Crew is added to the Initiative for purposes of turn order.

A typical crew member uses the Commoner stat block in the Monster Manual.

During a players turn they can take their normal Action or perform a *Crew Action* that benefits the operation of the vessel. 

Some positions such as weapons or engine components must continually be manned to offer benefits. A Player can still take their Bonus, Movement, and other such actions. Some *components* require a Player to stay within range to operate.

Essentially, a component must be manned for its *effect* to be available to the Ship during its Ship Phase.

### Operate

The most used Crew Action will be "Operate". Players and NPC Crew members will operate a component of the ship granting an effect or action that can be used during the ship phase. Here are some of the most common components of a ship:

**Movement.**
Each Movement Component of a ship adds a set distance (Speed Unit) to a Ship. Working the bait and tackle, shoveling coal into the engines, or just pulling the giant oars of a galley. No matter what method of locomotion your ship utilizes, your ship isn’t going anywhere without the strength of your crew’s backs. A Movement Component such as oars, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Water Vehicles) check. Making the Check will provide a Ship with movement equal to its Speed Unit stat. Failure results in movement equal to half of its Speed Unit stat being granted instead.

**Control.**
While for some rudimentary ships (like rowboats), the very act of sailing doubles as both locomotion and steering, for larger ships, a helmsman of some sort is usually required to prevent the ship from listing aimlessly.

Ships that have the “Helmsman Required” property may only move straight ahead if no one on board has taken the “Operate Helm” Crew Action that turn. The Helm action usually does not require an ability check; however, there are certain situations in which the DM may call for one, such as moving through difficult waters, or when requiring very precise maneuvering. In these cases, the check required is a Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom (Water Vehicles) check, with the type and DC varying depending on situation.

A character on board a ship that does not have the “Helmsman Required” feature can still perform the Helm Crew Action if they so wish, but it is not required to make turns. It would become important however if the ship is subjected to an effect that requires its helmsman to roll a Water Vehicles check.

**Weapons.**
The most common application of this "Operate" Action is when attempting to use a ship weapon. Whether it is a ballista, a cannon, a catapult, or 40 mm artillery batteries, all of a ship’s defense systems require someone to manually load, aim and then fire them.

A creature attempting to operate a weapon must specify which weapon they are operating when they take the action (but they do not have to specify their target). For a Crew member to take this Crew Action with a weapon, that weapon must be ready and available to be used (e.g., ranged weapons must be loaded with ammunition first). Attacks can vary widely depending on what kind of weapon is used. Consult the individual ship equipment section for more information.

For every crew member operating a weapon, the ship receives an Attack action with that weapon to its pool of available actions during the Ship Phase. Rolls for attack and damage are resolved when the attack actually takes place during the Ship Phase.

Other equipment on board a ship may also require the "Operate" Crew Action. The description of these items will detail how they are to be interacted with and their effect.

### Communicate

Crews that operate well with each other communicate their actions to other members. The ship then becomes a well oiled machine and able to rise in initiative. The following is taken from the Crew Action Command but is more aptly called Communicate.

While each sailor contributes in their own way to the efficiency of the ship, it is ultimately useless without people to co-ordinate it and ensure the ship doesn’t end up sailing in circles. Anyone is capable of taking the action, whether it’s a galley master beating a double time beat on the drums, a navy officer waving flag signals, or just someone passing on instructions to the sailors below deck.

Taking the “Communicate” Crew Action takes a successful DC 10 Charisma check. Success adds +2 to the ship’s initiative during the Ship Phase. This bonus only lasts for one round and a ship’s initiative score is reset to its normal value at the end of each round. There is no limit to how many characters may take the Communicate Crew Action in one round. Multiple successful Communicate Crew Actions stack.

### Forage 

The character casts out fishing lines, keeping an eye out for sources of food, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.

### Scan for Threats

Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of the characters or the crew to determine whether anyone on the ship notices a hidden threat. The crew has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score equal to 10 + Crew Quality.

The DM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a specific area of the ship. For example, only characters below deck might have a chance to hear or spot a creature hiding on board.

### Mutiny

A poorly led or mistreated crew might turn against its officers. Once per day, if a crew’s quality score is lower than 0, the captain must make a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check modified by the crew’s quality score.

If the check total is between 1 and 9, the crew’s quality score decreases by 1.

If the check total is 0 or lower, the crew mutinies. They become Hostile to the officers and might attempt to kill them, imprison them, or throw them overboard. The crew can be cowed into obedience through violence, Combat, or offers of Treasure or other Rewards.

When the DM ends the mutiny, the crew’s quality score increases by 1d4.

### Shore Leave

Life aboard a ship is a constant wear on the crew. Spending time in port allows the crew to relax and regain its composure. If a crew’s quality score is 3 or lower, the score increases by 1 for each day the crew spends in port or ashore.

## Officers

![img_center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tougher-Together-Gaming/default-game-assets/refs/heads/main/handouts/quick-reference/images/ship-actions-officers.png)

Each vessel requires people to run it: the officers in charge and the sailors who follow their orders.

If you’d like to explore running a ship, it needs officers to oversee its operations, officers who fill six different roles. Some roles aboard a ship reflect the need for trained experts to direct a crew’s efforts. Other roles focus on keeping the crew’s health and morale in order. The roles are meant to provide a sense of the types of Ability Checks useful to managing a ship. Of these, though, captain is the only role that must be filled for the ship to function. A ship needs a single person to issue orders and respond to threats, otherwise a ship risks chaos and confusion during a crisis.
