Glad to have you join this session for Invasion of Eirinn.

Be sure to check out the **Player References** folder for handouts regarding macros, Adventuring Gear, Downtime Activities, Factions, and more.

## **Token Bars**
Token bars are setup as follows: Bar 1: hp Bar 2: temp\_hp Bar 3: elevation

When you modify your HP (Bar 1), an API script will automatically adjust your temporary hp and hp bar to adjust.

## **Elevation and Range3D**
On non-hex maps, the distance is calculated using the optional **Diagonals** (Dungeon Master's Guide, page 252) rule. This is similar to Pathfinder's method. It allows for accurate Pythagorean calculation of angled distances and realistic movement.

With your token selected you can use the "Get-Range" macro to see in chat a statement of true distance to a target token.

## **Languages**
Your characters can speak and understand language sheets you have control of. With your token selected use the "Speak-Tongues" token action to see a drop down of that character sheets "known\_languages".

You can find these macros under [Macro Bar: Languages](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-M4N4-MdtXflrmiK8bxS). However, only in the Character Creation server are all languages shared for viewing. [Script fonts and image maps][Fonts]  are available from [Tougher Together's Github][Github].

## **Macros**
Tokens you control will have a "token actions" bar appear in top left corner when selected. There are other useful macros you can utilize by looking at the "Collections" tab and selecting "Show macro bar". You can also access non-token macros under [Macro Bar: Players](http://journal.roll20.net/character/-M4JY9N35onSFTc71M35).

I encourage you to turn these features on for access to features like Range3D, Calendar, Combat Master, and more.
