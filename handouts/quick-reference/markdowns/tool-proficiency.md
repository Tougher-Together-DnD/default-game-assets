# Tool Proficiencies

[Tool Proficiencies](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Chapter%202%20-%20Dungeon%20Master%27s%20Tools#h-Tool%20Proficiencies) are a useful way to highlight a character’s [Background](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Personal%20Decisions#h-Background) and talents. At the game table, though, the use of tools sometimes overlaps with the use of [Skills](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Skills), and it can be unclear how to use them together in certain situations. This section offers various ways that tools can be used in the game.

Taken from Xanathar's Guide to Everything (pg. 78)

## [Tools](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Tools#h-Tools) and [Skills](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Skills) Together

[Tools](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Tools#h-Tools) have more specific applications than [Skills](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Skills). The [History](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/History#h-History) skill applies to any event in the past. A tool such as a [Forgery Kit](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Forgery%20Kit#h-Forgery%20Kit) is used to make fake [Objects](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Objects#h-Objects) and little else. Thus, why would a character who has the opportunity to acquire one or the other want to gain a tool proficiency instead of proficiency in a skill?

To make [Tool Proficiencies](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Chapter%202%20-%20Dungeon%20Master%27s%20Tools#h-Tool%20Proficiencies) more attractive choices for the characters, you can use the methods outlined below.

**Advantage.** If the use of a tool and the use of a skill both apply to a check, and a character is proficient with the tool and the skill, consider allowing the character to make the check with advantage. This simple benefit can go a long way toward encouraging players to pick up [Tool Proficiencies](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Chapter%202%20-%20Dungeon%20Master%27s%20Tools#h-Tool%20Proficiencies). In the tool descriptions that follow, this benefit is often expressed as additional [Insight](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Insight#h-Insight) (or something similar), which translates into an increased chance that the check will be a success.

**Added Benefit.** In addition, consider giving characters who have both a relevant skill and a relevant tool proficiency an added benefit on a successful check. This benefit might be in the form of more detailed information or could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful check. For example, a character proficient with mason’s tools makes a successful [Wisdom](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Wisdom) (Perception) check to find a [Secret](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cleric#h-Secret) door in a stone wall. Not only does the character notice the door’s presence, but you decide that the tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic success on an [Intelligence](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Intelligence) (Investigation) check to determine how to open the door.

## Tool Descriptions

The following sections go into detail about the tools presented in the *Player’s Handbook*, offering advice on how to use them in a campaign.

**Components.** The first paragraph in each description gives details on what a set of supplies or tools is made up of. A character who is proficient with a tool knows how to use all of its component parts.

**Skills.** Every tool potentially provides advantage on a check when used in conjunction with certain [Skills](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Skills), provided a character is proficient with the tool and the skill. As DM, you can allow a character to make a check using the indicated skill with advantage. Paragraphs that begin with skill names discuss these possibilities. In each of these paragraphs, the benefits apply only to someone who has proficiency with the tool, not someone who simply owns it.

With respect to [Skills](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Skills), the system is mildly abstract in terms of what a tool proficiency represents; essentially, it assumes that a character who has proficiency with a tool also has learned about facets of the trade or profession that are not necessarily associated with the use of the tool.

In addition, you can consider giving a character extra information or an added benefit on a skill check. The text provides some examples and ideas when this opportunity is relevant.

**Special Use.** Proficiency with a tool usually brings with it a particular benefit in the form of a special use, as described in this paragraph.

**Sample DCs.** A table at the end of each section lists activities that a tool can be used to perform, and suggested DCs for the necessary [Ability Checks](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Social%20Interaction#h-Ability%20Checks).

## Calligrapher’s Supplies

Calligraphy treats writing as a delicate, beautiful art. Calligraphers produce text that is pleasing to the eye, using a style that is difficult to forge. Their supplies also give them some ability to examine scripts and determine if they are legitimate, since a calligrapher’s [Training](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Resting#h-Training) involves long hours of studying writing and attempting to replicate its style and design.

**[Components](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#h-Components).** Calligrapher’s supplies include ink, a dozen sheets of [Parchment](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Parchment#h-Parchment), and three quills.

**[Arcana](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Arcana#h-Arcana).** Although calligraphy is of little help in deciphering the content of magical writings, proficiency with these supplies can aid in identifying who wrote a script of a magical [Nature](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Nature#h-Nature).

## Cobbler’s Tools

You can learn where someone has recently visited by examining the wear and the dirt that has accumulated on their shoes. Your experience in repairing shoes makes it easier for you to [Identify](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Identify#h-Identify) where damage might come from.

**Maintain Shoes.** As part of a [Long Rest](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Social%20Interaction#h-Long%20Rest), you can repair your companions’ shoes.

## [Disguise kit](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Disguise%20kit#h-Disguise%20kit)

The perfect tool for anyone who wants to engage in trickery, a [Disguise kit](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Disguise%20kit#h-Disguise%20kit) enables its owner to adopt a false identity.

**[Intimidation](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Intimidation#h-Intimidation).** The right disguise can make you look more fearsome, whether you want to scare someone away by posing as a plague victim or intimidate a gang of thugs by taking the appearance of a bully.

**[Performance](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Performance#h-Performance).** A cunning disguise can enhance an audience’s enjoyment of a [Performance](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Performance#h-Performance), provided the disguise is properly designed to evoke the desired [Reaction](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sorcerer#h-Reaction).

**[Persuasion](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Persuasion#h-Persuasion).** Folk tend to trust a person in uniform. If you disguise yourself as an authority figure, your efforts to persuade others are often more effective.

**Create Disguise.** As part of a [Long Rest](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Social%20Interaction#h-Long%20Rest), you can create a disguise. It takes you 1 minute to don such a disguise once you have created it.

Each disguise weighs 1 pound.
