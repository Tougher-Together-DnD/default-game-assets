# Mounts and Vehicles
A good mount can help you move more quickly through the [Wilderness](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Wilderness#h-Wilderness), but its primary [Purpose](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Settlements#h-Purpose) is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The [Mounts](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mounts%20and%20Services#h-Mounts) and [Other Animals](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Appendix%20A%20-%20Miscellaneous%20Creatures%20%28Monster%20Manual%29#h-Other%20Animals) table shows each animal’s speed and base carrying [Capacity](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sample%20Ships#h-Capacity).

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying [Capacity](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sample%20Ships#h-Capacity), including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying [Capacity](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sample%20Ships#h-Capacity) together.

Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of D&D, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying [Mounts](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mounts%20and%20Services#h-Mounts) (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic [Mounts](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mounts%20and%20Services#h-Mounts) (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.

**Barding.** [Barding](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Barding#h-Barding) is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the [Armor](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Armor%20and%20Shields#h-Armor) table in this chapter can be purchased as [Barding](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Barding#h-Barding). The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for [Humanoids](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Parleying%20with%20Monsters#h-Humanoids), and it weighs twice as much.

**Saddles.** A [Military](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Government#h-Military) saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.

**Vehicle Proficiency.** If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your [Proficiency Bonus](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Introduction%20%28Xanathar%27s%29#h-Proficiency%20Bonus) to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.

**Rowed Vessels.** Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A [Rowboat](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rowboat#h-Rowboat) weighs 100 pounds, in case [Adventurers](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Tosculi#h-Adventurers) carry it over land.

## Owning a Ship
At some point in your campaign, the [Adventurers](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Tosculi#h-Adventurers) might gain custody of a ship. They might purchase or [Capture](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/The%20Underdark#h-Capture) one or receive one to carry out a mission. It’s up to you whether a ship is available for purchase, and you have the power to deprive the [Adventurers](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Tosculi#h-Adventurers) of a ship at any time should it become a nuisance (see the “Shipwrecks” sidebar).

[***Crew***](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Franchise%20Advancement#h-Crew). A ship needs a crew of [Skilled](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Skilled#h-Skilled) [Hirelings](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hirelings#h-Hirelings) to function. As per the *Player’s Handbook*, one [Skilled](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Skilled#h-Skilled) hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum number of [Skilled](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Skilled#h-Skilled) [Hirelings](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hirelings#h-Hirelings) needed to crew a ship depends on the type of vessel, as shown in the Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table.

You can track the loyalty of individual crew [Members](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Members%20Only#h-Members) or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules in chapter 4. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal during a voyage, the crew turns [Hostile](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mysterious%20Islands#h-Hostile) and stages a mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew [Members](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Members%20Only#h-Members) leave the ship and never return.

***Passengers***. The table indicates the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate. Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers.

A [Passenger](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Random%20Ships#h-Passenger) is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day.

[***Cargo***](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Random%20Ships#h-Cargo). The table indicates the maximum tonnage each kind of ship can carry.

[***Damage Threshold***](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sample%20Ships#h-Damage%20Threshold). A ship has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than its [Damage Threshold](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sample%20Ships#h-Damage%20Threshold), in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the [Damage Threshold](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sample%20Ships#h-Damage%20Threshold) is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the ship’s [Hit Points](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Hit%20Points).

***Ship Repair***. [Repairs](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Infernal%20War%20Machines%20Rules#h-Repairs) to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor.
