# Lingering Injuries

Adventuring is perilous, and the scars of battle often remain long after the fight is over. Many NPCs bear visible marks of their journeys—signs of the challenges they’ve faced. Critical hits in this campaign can leave a lasting impression. When struck by a critical hit, roll on the **Lingering Injury Table** to see the effects. Some injuries are minor, like a cosmetic scar, while others impose ongoing challenges.

## Healing

Healing lingering injuries requires rest, ingenuity, or magic. Mundane treatments, such as Healer’s Kits, can reduce recovery time, while high-level spells like *regenerate* can completely restore lost body parts. Lesser magic, such as *minor restoration*, can address cosmetic effects or minor injuries. Time and care are essential for those without access to magic.

### Sufficient Magical Healing

When the remedy specifies, healing the target site for half the damage that caused the lingering injury will resolve the condition.

### Prosthetics

Prosthetics provide practical and innovative solutions for those who lose limbs or suffer debilitating injuries. 

- **Basic Prosthetics** restore simple functionality, such as walking or holding items.
- **Magical Prosthetics** often grant special boons, such as:
  - A **prosthetic hand** enchanted with *mage hand*, allowing the wearer to manipulate objects at a distance.
  - A **prosthetic leg** that improves speed or stability.
  - A **magical eye** that grants enhanced vision or darkvision.

Prosthetics are crafted with care and creativity, blending utility with personal style. Many adventurers carry these marks of resilience as symbols of their strength.

## **Roleplaying Your Injury**

Lingering injuries and prosthetics add depth to your character. A magical prosthetic might become a signature part of your story, while scars serve as badges of honor—or shame. How your character adapts to these changes can define their resilience and create memorable moments in their journey.
