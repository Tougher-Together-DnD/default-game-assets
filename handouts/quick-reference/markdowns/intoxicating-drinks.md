## Intoxication Threshold
To gain an effect after each glass of a drink make a Constitution Saving Throw Vs. Intoxication (10 + Strength of Drink + any levels of [Exhaustion](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules%3AConditions?sharedCompendium=11497404#toc_4)). Upon a failure add a level of **Inebriation** to your character and apply the effect.

##### Table 2 - Character Levels of Inebriation

| Inebriated | Name | Effects |
| :-------: |:---:|:---|
| 0 | Sober | No ill effects |
| 1 | Slight | Roll from Table Two. |
| 2 | Moderate | Additional Effect from Table Two (Must be different Effect), Saving Throw Vs. [Exhaustion](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules%3AConditions?sharedCompendium=11497404#toc_4) |
| 3 | Significant | Saving Throw Vs. additional level of [Exhaustion](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules%3AConditions?sharedCompendium=11497404#toc_4) |
| 4 | Critical | Saving Throw Vs. additional level of [Exhaustion](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules%3AConditions?sharedCompendium=11497404#toc_4). Failure also has Character fall unconscious for 1d4 hours. |

| 3 | "Full Sail" | You become gregarious and dominate conversations with a litany of wit and words. (Advantage on Charisma and Wisdom Checks). |

| 5 | "Battered and Fried" | Having staid yourself on fried foods and bar refreshments you become desensitized to pain. (you gain Temporary Hit points equal to two hit die) |
| 6 | "Up for Anything" | You lose many of your inhibitions. (Each person who talks to you has the same effect as *Suggestion* cast upon you. You make your Wisdom saving throw at a Disadvantage). |
| 7 | "Oiled Up" | Your joints and movement feel less stiff. Added with lower inhibitions you subconsciously apply your full strength to actions. (Advantage on Strength Ability Checks). |

## Detoxing and Hangovers
Your **Levels of Inebriation** are decreased by 1 at the end of a short rest, and are zero at the end of a long rest.

If you have at least 1 level of exhaustion gained from intoxication and no **Levels of Inebriation**, you have a ***Hangover***.

While you’re ***hungover***, you are vulnerable to thunder damage and have disadvantage against being blinded. You lose 4 levels of intoxication from a use of lesser restoration. You lose your hangover at the end of a long rest or from a use of greater restoration (must be used after [exhaustion](https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules%3AConditions?sharedCompendium=11497404#toc_4) is cured).

## Record of Exposure
Due to physical and psychological effects, many people have the belief that the same type of liquor consistently affects them the same way. Record your results for each type of liquor you partake of, for quick reference for effects to apply.
