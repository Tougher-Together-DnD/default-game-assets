# House Rules and Gameplay Mechanics

Welcome to the table! These house rules aim to keep gameplay immersive and fluid, empowering players to focus on strategy, creativity, and storytelling. The following sections guide you through what to expect during your turn, how to make decisions, and how the game world interacts with your character's actions. If you feel any these house rules negatively impact a particular skill or feature of your character talk to your Dungeon Master (DM). Sometimes to restore balance to the game the DM will choose to modify that skill or feat. Such as the "Master Weapon" feat.

These modifications are to adapt the game mechanics to the style of play preferred by players and dungeons masters. They are designed to make combat move faster, give bonuses for tactical decisions, more options and actions in a single turn. Players accustomed to playing Rules-As-Written (RAW) might find the combat is not as repetitive or mechanical; Hopefully a little more realistic and dynamic as well.

***

## Roleplay over Roll

This flowchart provides a clear decision-making process for when to require dice rolls, helping you maintain a balance between storytelling and mechanics. Follow these steps during gameplay:

1. **Evaluate the Challenge**: 
   - If the environment, object, or motive isn’t challenging, there’s no need to roll; roleplay the success.  
   - If it is challenging, move to the next step.

2. **Assess Character Expertise**:
   - If the task reasonably falls within the character's "wheelhouse" (e.g., a thief unlocking a simple padlock, or a sailor steering a ship in calm waters), grant success through roleplay.  
   - If not, set a **Difficulty Class (DC)** for the task.

3. **Leverage Passive Scores**:
   - Compare the character's relevant **passive score** (e.g., Passive Perception, Passive Investigation) to the DC. If it meets or exceeds the DC, allow success without a roll.  
     - **Passive Perception**: Detect how things are in your environment.
     - **Passive Investigation**: Understand how things work.
     - **Passive Insight**: Sense the emotions and motives of others.

4. **Roll If Needed**:
   - If the passive score isn’t enough, the player rolls a die and adds the appropriate modifier. Compare the result to the DC to determine success or failure.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Simple Task**: A character attempts to climb a ladder.  
   - **Flowchart Path**: The environment isn't inherently challenging. Roleplay success.

2. **Within Expertise**: A rogue picks a standard lock.  
   - **Flowchart Path**: The lock is somewhat challenging, but the rogue’s expertise fits the task. Roleplay success.

3. **Challenging Task**: A bard tries to decipher an ancient, coded map.  
   - **Flowchart Path**: The map is inherently challenging, and decoding it isn’t within the bard’s wheelhouse. Set a DC and check their Passive Investigation. If their passive is too low, they roll to determine success or setback.

### Appropriate DC Levels

As a DM avoid increasing the DC to keep pace with characters. If a DC to open a footlocker was 15 at level 5, do not make the same footlocker 18 at level 10. Simple accept the characters are experienced, make other things challenge them (and the players). When setting a DC address it with no regard to the character's ability scores, base a DC on how challenging it would be in the world.

I would consider most 'wheel house' skills to be DC 12-15, therefore consider the character performing the action to decide if a roll is required or if the character's background and innate characteristics make a roll superfluous.

| **Task Difficulty** | **DC** | **Description**                                               |
| :------------------ | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Very Easy**       | 5      | So simple almost anyone could do it without effort.           |
| **Easy**            | 8      | A straightforward task requiring minimal skill.               |
| **Medium**          | 10     | Requires focus or basic competence to succeed.                |
| **Tricky**          | 12     | Needs some skill, cleverness, or careful execution.           |
| **Hard**            | 15     | Challenging and requires expertise or good planning.          |
| **Very Hard**       | 20     | Exceptional difficulty; only skilled individuals can succeed. |
| **Incredibly Hard** | 25     | Extraordinary challenge; demands near-perfection.             |
| **Why Bother?**     | 30     | Practically impossible; requires immense skill and luck.      |

***

## Combat

A DM switches from pure roleplay to combat in D&D when the situation escalates to require structured resolution, typically due to immediate threats, heightened conflict, or the need for tactical precision. This transition often occurs when diplomacy or stealth fails, when characters face life-threatening danger, or when player decisions provoke hostility. Combat provides clear mechanics for timing, movement, and resources, ensuring fairness and clarity in high-stakes scenarios.

However, combat can slow the game and consume significant time to resolve. The following House Rules aim to streamline the transition between roleplay and structured combat, maintaining smooth gameplay while preserving tactical depth.

### Initiative Turn Order

Initiative determines the order in which players, NPCs, and creatures take their turns during combat. After every **combat** or **rest**, players roll for initiative to establish the **"around the table" turn order** for the next encounter. This order stays the same until the next rest or combat.

#### NPC and Creature Initiative

The initiative for NPCs and creatures is pre-set based on their role in the encounter:

| **Role**                     | **Initiative** | **Description**                                           |
| :--------------------------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Boss NPCs**                | **21**         | Commanding presence, acts first to establish dominance.   |
| **Home Field Advantage**     | **15**         | Creatures in their lair or favored environment act early. |
| **Mini-Bosses/Shot Callers** | **11**         | Secondary leaders who direct other creatures.             |
| **Party Sidekicks**          | **5**          | Helpful allies who support players.                       |
| **Minions**                  | **4**          | Lesser creatures, often numerous and acting as a group.   |

#### Special Initiative Rules

- **Jump Start Reaction**: Character's can use their **reaction** to act first in the round. If multiple characters do this, their original initiative decides who goes first.
- **Surprise Round**: If characters ambush enemies, they act first without spending a reaction. Creatures surprised by the ambush lose their reaction for the round.
- **Familiars and summons**: NPC creatures act on the same turn as the player who controls them. They **do not roll for initiative** or act separately.
- **Natural 20**: If you roll a natural 20, you may **choose your position** in the turn order, acting before or after another player of your choice.
- **Pass Turn**: Unsure of what to do? You can pass your turn and act before the next NPC’s turn.

### Action Economy on Your Turn

Action economy represents the energy your character uses during their turn to change the environment, interact with the scene, or influence the game state. On your turn, you can use a **Main Action** (for impactful tasks like attacking, casting a spell, or dashing), a **Bonus Action** (if available) for smaller tasks tied to specific abilities or spells, and **Movement** to reposition up to your speed. You can perform these actions in any order, splitting movement or inserting a Bonus Action between other actions as needed. Additionally, you have a Reaction to respond to triggers outside your turn (like opportunity attacks).

1. **Main Action**:  
   - The most impactful thing you do during your turn.  
   - Examples: Attack, cast a spell, use an item, grapple, shove, or dash.

2. **Bonus Action** (if available):  
   - A smaller action you can use alongside your Main Action.  
   - Some abilities, spells, or features specifically require a Bonus Action.

3. **Movement**:  
   - Move up to your character’s speed (e.g., 30 feet).  
   - You can split your movement between other actions (e.g., move, attack, then move again).

4. **Free Action**:
   - You get at least one free actions, but can have more if the DM allows.
   - These are usually things so common, so easy, so simple, that performing them can be done in 1 second while performing the other actions.

You can imagine your action economy as a nested set of intents. Once you have chosen a Main Action, you can only perform what is left in your Bonus, Move, and free actions.

![img_center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tougher-Together-Gaming/default-game-assets/refs/heads/main/handouts/quick-reference/images/tougher-together-house-rules-nested-actions.png)

#### Main Action

The most impactful thing you do during your turn. Your Main Action is the also most versatile, allowing you to:

| **Intent**                         | **Description**                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attack Main Hand Weapon**        | Use weapons to deal damage or apply effects to a target.                                                         |
| **Cast a Spell (1 action)**        | Cast a spell with casting time of one Action.                                                                    |
| **Unarmed Strike**                 | Headbutt, Knee, elbow, or other physical body attack. If currently grappling an opponent may include choke hold. |
| **Disengage**                      | Move without provoking opportunity attacks until the end of your turn.                                           |
| **Dodge**                          | Focus on defense, gaining advantage on Dexterity saving throws and imposing disadvantage on attacks against you. |

| **Ready**                          | Prepare an action to trigger under specific conditions (*requires concentrating* until your next turn).          |
| **Administer a potion to Another** | Aid a willing or unconscious creature in digesting a potion.                                                     |
| **Drink a Potion**                 | Use a potion to heal or gain its effects during combat.                                                          |

| **Perform a Movement Action**      | Use your action to perform any movement action.                                                                  |
| **Perform a Free Action**          | Use your action to perform any movement action.                                                                  |

### Bonus Action

A Bonus Action is a quick, additional activity you can perform on your turn to complement your Main Action or Movement. Bonus Actions are typically tied to specific abilities, spells, or effects that have prerequisites or conditions. Once the condition is met, you can use the Bonus Action immediately, even in the middle of a multi-attack or movement. you can expend your bonus action to:

| **Intent**                        | **Description**                                                                                                           |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Attack Off Hand Weapon**        | Use weapons to deal damage or apply effects to a target.                                                                  |
| **Activate Abilities**            | Trigger class features, racial traits, or other abilities that require a Bonus Action.                                    |
| **Cast a Spell (1 bonus action)** | Cast a spell with a casting time of one Bonus Action.                                                                     |
| **Martial Mastery Property**      | If you are proficient with a martial weapon you can expend a bonus action to perform its martial mastery move (see below) |
| **Pin/Lift**                      | If already grappling a creature, attempt to pin them to the ground or lift them in the air.                               |
| **Overrun**                       | Attempt to run through an area blocked by enemies. May include an Athletics (Strength) or Acrobatics (Dexterity) Check.   |
| **Break a Condition**             | Attempt to escape a grapple or resist a condition with a saving throw or ability check.                                   |
| **Search/Study/Insight**          | Investigate the environment, analyze clues, or gain insight into creatures or situations.                                 |
| **Perform a 1/2 Movement Action** | Use your bonus action to perform an intent that would normally cost half movement speed.                                  |

### Movement

Your movement speed represents how far your character can travel during your turn. By default, you can move up to your **base speed** (usually 30 feet) using the **Move Action**. Movement can be split across other actions during your turn, allowing for strategic positioning. For example, you can move, attack, and then move again if you have remaining speed (units (feet) left of base speed).

In addition to moving across the battlefield, you can use **half your base movement speed** to perform specific actions that require physical effort. This allows for greater flexibility and more actions during combat (which makes combat more fast paced). You can only perform **One** of these special actions in a turn.

| **Intent**                        | **Description**                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Movement**                      | Advance your character along a path up to your base movement speed.                                     |
| **Collaborate with Companions\*** | Give verbal commands to familiars, summoned creatures, or ranger's animal companions. They can respond. |
| **Toss an Item\***                | Throw an item to an ally.                                                                               |
| **Mount/Dismount\***              | Get on or off a vehicle or steed.                                                                       |
| **Perform a Free Action\***       | Use half your movement speed to execute an additional free action.                                      |

\* Consumes half base movement speed
\* once used only dash movement is allowed with remaining speed.

### Free Actions

Free Actions are simple, quick tasks that your character can perform without using any of your other actions (Movement, Main Action, or Bonus Action). These actions require minimal effort and can be done on your turn or as part of another action. While they don’t consume resources, the DM may limit the number of Free Actions you can take during a turn to keep gameplay balanced and realistic.

| **Intent**                    | **Description**                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speak Briefly**             | Say a quick phrase, shout or announce something. A response is not included.                                                  |
| **Drop an Item**              | Release an object or weapon you’re holding.                                                                                   |
| **Drop Concentration**        | Release concentrating on a spell or readied action.                                                                           |
| **Draw or Sheathe a Weapon**  | Equip or stow a single weapon. (Limited to once per turn unless stated otherwise by a feat.)                                  |
| **Interact with Environment** | Perform simple tasks, like opening an unlocked door, flipping a switch, or grabbing a nearby object.                          |
| **Draw an Item**              | Fetch an prepared item from a pouch or belt loop (if a free hand is available.). This can be things like a potion, rope, ect. |
| **Look Around**               | Glance at the surroundings for *obvious* details or changes.                                                                  |

### Boons, Banes, and Environmental Factors

Once you have decided on what your character will do, announce each part to your Dungeon Master (DM). If required the Dm will call for a roll. Your die roll will be augmented by a few factors. First you may be asked to roll twice to take the lower (disadvantage) or higher (advantage). Then we apply your flat bonuses to both rolls. To add more impact to tactical situations and manuevers, some things that RAW grant advantage will now grant +2 bonus. more than one flat bonus can be added to a roll, however only one advantage or disadvantage can occur.

The following modifications change what would normally grant advantage into +2 flat bonuses.

#### +2 Flat Boon

- Range weapon attack while prone
- Flanking (being on 180 degree opposite sides of the opponent)

#### -2 Flat Bane

- Melee weapon attack while Prone.
- Attacks while submerged (if you lack a swimming speed)
- Attacks while climbing (if you lack a climbing speed)
- Attacks while falling or flying (if you lack a flying speed)

#### Point Blank Range

- Ranged weapon attacks within 5ft of hostile do not incur disadvantage.
- Ranged spell attacks while casting a cantrip within 5ft of a hostile do not incur disadvantage.

## Modified Weapon Mastery

> Weapon Master Feat (Modified)
> You have practiced extensively with a variety of weapons, gaining the following benefits:
> Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
> You gain proficiency with four weapons of your choice. Each one must be a simple or a martial weapon.
> *If you already have proficiency with the chosen weapon, you gain expertise.*

These are modifications of the 2024 Weapon Mastery Properties for each weapon. All Martial weapons have mastery properties.

A Character can perform one of the additional effects as a bonus action if they are proficient with a weapon.

| **Mastery Property** | **Effect**                                                                      | **Applicable Weapons**                                              |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cleave**           | Make an additional attack against a second adjacent target.                     | Greataxe, Halberd                                                   |
| **Graze**            | Deal damage equal to your ability modifier on a missed attack.                  | Glaive, Greatsword                                                  |
| **Nick**             | Make an additional attack with your off-hand weapon during the Attack action.   | Dagger, Light Hammer, Sickle, Cane Scimitar                         |
| **Push**             | Push the target 10 feet away after a successful hit.                            | Greatclub, Pike, Warhammer, Heavy Crossbow                          |
| **Sap**              | Impose disadvantage on the target's next attack roll after a hit.               | Mace, Spear, Flail, Longsword, Morningstar, War Pick, Pistol        |
| **Slow**             | Reduce the target's speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.         | Club, Javelin, Light Crossbow, Sling, Whip, Longbow, Musket         |
| **Topple**           | Force the target to make a Constitution saving throw or fall prone after a hit. | Quarterstaff, Battleaxe, Lance, Maul, Trident                       |
| **Vex**              | Gain advantage on your next attack roll against the same target after a hit.    | Handaxe, Dart, Shortbow, Rapier, Shortsword, Blowgun, Hand Crossbow |

*Note: Characters can draw or stow one weapon each time they attack as part of the Attack action, allowing for strategic weapon switching during combat. A Player could draw and attack, next turn attack and stow, third turn draw and attack with different weapon. Alternatively a character can drop a weapon without expending an Interact with Object free action.*  

***

## Miscellaneous Changes

### Empowered Healing

All Healing spells (2014 versions) will roll one additional die in addition to the normal amount.
Creatures that are **immune** to *Necrotic* take damage from healing spells.

When using healing potions the first die is maximized.

### Spiritual Weapon Clarifications

Spiritual weapons are not creatures. They do not have a will to act at their own discretion. As such they have no **reaction** for opportunity attacks. They are ephemeral, therefore can not stop another creature from passing through them. They still grant a flanking bonus to other creatures, as that bonus stems from the target being distracted and less about the attackers. A spiritual weapon can only perform two tasks: Attack and Move.

### Downtime Activity

At the end of a long rest you roll a 1d4 for Downtime days accrued as a resource. You can expend these days during a long rest within an Inn or other safe places to perform out of session Downtime Activities. 

### Inspiration Pool

Instead of standard Inspiration, when awarded by the DM, you will gain **1 Inspiration Point** to store and use at your discretion. On your turn, you can spend these points to **adjust your roll** by 1 per point spent, either increasing or decreasing the roll result. This gives you more control over when and how you use your Inspiration, turning it into a valuable strategic resource.

### Stealth and Group Checks
When the party attempts a group stealth check, the **highest and lowest stealth rolls** are averaged to determine the party’s DC. You must be at least **30 feet away** to roll for individual stealth (unless using special features).

### Exhaustion After 0 HP
If you are reduced to **0 hit points** and then restored, you immediately gain **1 level of exhaustion**. This reflects the physical toll of being brought back from the brink of death and adds tension to future battles.

### Falling onto a Creature

If a creature falls into the space of a second creature and neither of them is Tiny, the second creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be impacted by the falling creature, and any damage resulting from the fall is divided evenly between them

### Unwillingly Dismounted

When a mounted creature is unwillingly dismounted off of a vehicle or mount, that creature becomes prone.

### Critical Hits

Critical Hits will have one maximized die added to the normal roll (no modifiers). (Optionally) the creature being critically hit rolls on the Lingering Injury.
