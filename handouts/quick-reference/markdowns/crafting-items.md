# Crafting Items

Crafting items in Dungeons & Dragons allows characters to transform raw materials into something unique and personal, whether it’s a finely tuned weapon, a potion of healing, or a magical artifact infused with creativity and purpose. It’s a way for adventurers to use their downtime meaningfully. For many Characters crafting isn’t just about utility; it’s a form of self-expression and a chance to shape the world with their own hands.

**Optional Usage**  
This handout is an optional feature that replaces "crafting" as written in the Dungeon Master Guide (DMG) or Xanathar's Guide to Everything (XgtE) Downtime Activities. As such its meant to make crafting meld with the roleplay adventure. Making your players look for additional resources to make their build stronger. This is a great addition to worlds low on items, or things to purchase.

An important change to bear in mind is: Characters do **not** need to be spellcasters to create magic items. Material components and spell slots are not expended, except for spell scrolls. The magic of an item comes from the preparation of the exotic material used in the recipe.

## Requirements

###### Crafting Requirements Table

| **Requirement**               | **Details**                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Formula                       | A formula, blueprint, or recipe is required. It provides the knowledge to prepare materials, whether for magical or common. |
| Materials                     | Exotic materials for magical items or common materials for non-magical items.                                               |
| Gold Cost and Time Cost       | Costs and crafting times vary based on the item's rarity and materials, often tied to creature encounters.                  |
| Tools and Skill Proficiencies | Specific tools (e.g., Jeweler’s Tools) and skills (e.g., Arcana) are needed to craft items successfully.                    |

### Formula

A crafting formula, blueprint, or recipe is essential for creating any item. It serves as a guide, detailing how to prepare materials, combine components, and follow the steps needed to produce a finished product. For magical items, the formula explains how to infuse the materials with arcane properties, ensuring the item functions as intended. Without a formula, even the most skilled craftsman risks wasting materials, time, and gold.

Formulas can be found as treasure, purchased from merchants or crafting guilds, or earned as rewards for completing quests. Characters can also create their own formulas through research and experimentation, using skill checks (e.g., Arcana, Nature, or Investigation), spending gold on materials, and dedicating time to the process. Whether discovered or invented, formulas add depth to crafting by encouraging exploration, problem-solving, and creativity, making the creation of items feel more rewarding and tied to the adventure.

### Materials

Materials are the pragmatic components needed for crafting, ranging from common resources like leather, iron, and herbs to rare and exotic items such as dragon scales or phoenix feathers. Common materials are easy to find or purchase, while exotic materials often require exploration, combat, or quests to obtain, making them integral to the adventure. For example, a cloak of frost resistance might require yeti fur, while a flaming sword could need lava-forged obsidian.

Characters can gather resources from creatures, mine rare minerals, or purchase supplies from specialized merchants. Some materials may also need refining, such as smelting ores into usable ingots or treating hides into leather. Rare and legendary materials often involve greater challenges, adding a sense of achievement to the crafting process. By linking materials to exploration and roleplay, crafting becomes an adventure, creating meaningful and memorable items.

###### Crafting Materials, Cost, and Time Table

| **Item Rarity** | **Material CR Range** | **Cost**   | **Workweeks** |
| :-------------- | :-------------------- | :--------- | :------------ |
| Non-Magical     | less than 1           | 25 gp      | .5            |
| Common          | 1–3                   | 50 gp      | 1             |
| Uncommon        | 4–8                   | 200 gp     | 2             |
| Rare            | 9–12                  | 2,000 gp   | 10            |
| Very Rare       | 13–18                 | 20,000 gp  | 25            |
| Legendary       | 19+                   | 100,000 gp | 50            |

### Gold and Time Cost

Crafting an item takes both monetary investment and time, reflecting the resources and effort needed to create something of value. The gold cost covers incidental expenses such as tools, workspace, basic materials, and magical reagents, while the time represents the labor and focus required to complete the process. These factors scale with the rarity of the item. Common items are relatively quick and inexpensive, while rare or legendary creations demand significant time and resources.

### Tools and Skills proficiencies

A Character attempting to make an item will need the right tools and the expertise. Each type of item relies on specific tools, such as Smith’s Tools for forging weapons or Herbalism Kits for brewing potions. In some cases, relevant skill checks like Arcana, Nature, or Medicine may be required, especially for crafting magical or complex items.

These skills reflect the character’s deeper understanding of the materials or magic involved. Without the proper tools or proficiencies, crafting becomes much harder, increasing the risk of failure or wasting resources.

## Crafting Challenges

Even when all the requirements for crafting are met, setbacks can occur, adding tension and narrative depth to the process. Crafting isn't always a straightforward task; tools may break, rival artisans might interfere, or unforeseen events can complicate progress. These challenges represent the unpredictability of crafting in a dynamic world and offer opportunities for roleplay and creative problem-solving.

| 2           | Your tools are stolen, forcing you to buy new ones.   |
| 3           | A local wizard insists on observing your work.        |
| 4           | A noble demands your work for themselves.             |
| 5           | A dwarf clan accuses you of stealing its secrets.     |
| 6           | A competitor spreads rumors that your work is faulty. |

## Selling Magic Items

Selling magic items isn’t as simple as walking into a market and naming your price. Magic is rare and valuable, and finding the right buyer requires effort, time, and a bit of luck. To sell a magic item, a character must spend **25 gp per workweek** to spread the word, advertise their item, or network with potential buyers. Only one magic item can be sold at a time, emphasizing the unique nature of these transactions.

Once a buyer is found, the final price depends on the seller’s ability to negotiate. A **Charisma (Persuasion)** check determines the offer made, with higher rolls yielding more lucrative deals. The rarity of the item also influences its base price, as shown below:

###### Selling Magic Item Negotiations Table

| **Rarity** | **Roll 1–10** | **Roll 11–20** | **Roll 21+** |
| :--------- | :------------ | :------------- | :----------- |
| Common     | 50 gp         | 100 gp         | 150 gp       |
| Uncommon   | 200 gp        | 400 gp         | 600 gp       |
| Rare       | 2,000 gp      | 4,000 gp       | 6,000 gp     |
| Very Rare  | 20,000 gp     | 40,000 gp      | 60,000 gp    |
| Legendary  | 100,000 gp    | 200,000 gp     | 300,000 gp   |

Selling magic items can lead to roleplay opportunities, as the process of finding buyers may draw the attention of merchants, nobles, or even thieves. Players should be prepared to negotiate, navigate complications, or turn down unfavorable offers. The challenge of selling magic items makes them feel valuable and reinforces their role as treasures in the world.
