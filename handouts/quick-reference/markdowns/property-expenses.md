# Property Expenses
Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a particular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional drains on their adventuring income. Player characters who come into possession of property, own businesses, and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that accompany these ventures.

It’s not unusual for adventurers—especially after 10th level—to gain possession of a castle, a tavern, or another piece of property. They might buy it with their hard-won loot, take it by force, obtain it in a lucky draw from a *deck of many things*, or acquire it by other means.

The Maintenance Costs table shows the per-day upkeep cost for any such property. (The cost of a normal residence isn’t included here because it falls under lifestyle expenses, as discussed in the *Player’s Handbook*.) Maintenance expenses need to be paid every 30 days. Given that adventurers spend much of their time adventuring, staff includes a steward who can make payments in the party’s absence.

**Total Cost per Day.** The cost includes everything it takes to maintain the property and keep things running smoothly, including the salaries of hirelings. If the property earns money that can offset maintenance costs (by charging fees, collecting tithes or donations, or selling goods), that is taken into account in the table.

**Skilled and Untrained Hirelings**. Skilled hirelings are professionals with specific proficiencies (such as in weapons, tools, or skills) and include mercenaries, artisans, or scribes, often requiring higher pay. Unskilled hirelings perform basic labor or tasks needing no special expertise, such as porters, maids, or general laborers.

**Garrisons**: Castles and keeps employ soldiers (use the veteran and guard statistics in the *Monster Manual*) to defend them. Roadside inns, outposts and forts, palaces, and temples rely on less-experienced defenders (use the guard statistics in the *Monster Manual*). These armed warriors make up the bulk of a property’s skilled hirelings.

## Running a Business

Adventurer-owned businesses can sustain themselves and even earn profits, but owners must occasionally check in to ensure operations run smoothly. Use the **Running a Business** table to determine the outcome of tending to the business during downtime.

1. **Roll 1d100 + downtime days**: Characters can donate Downtime days to being present and managing the business (maximum 30 days).  
2. **Promote the business**: By spending 1gp per day to gain a +1 bonus to the roll (maximum +30).  
3. **Debts**: If required to pay costs due to the roll and fail to do so, the business incurs debts. Each unpaid debt imposes a -10 penalty on future rolls.
