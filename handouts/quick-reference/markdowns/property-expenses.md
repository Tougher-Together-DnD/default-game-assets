# Property Expenses
Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a particular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional drains on their adventuring income. Player characters who come into possession of property, own businesses, and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that accompany these ventures.

It’s not unusual for adventurers—especially after 10th level—to gain possession of a castle, a tavern, or another piece of property. They might buy it with their hard-won loot, take it by force, obtain it in a lucky draw from a *deck of many things*, or acquire it by other means.

The Maintenance Costs table shows the per-day upkeep cost for any such property. (The cost of a normal residence isn’t included here because it falls under lifestyle expenses, as discussed in the *Player’s Handbook*.) Maintenance expenses need to be paid every 30 days. Given that adventurers spend much of their time adventuring, staff includes a steward who can make payments in the party’s absence.

**Total Cost per Day.** The cost includes everything it takes to maintain the property and keep things running smoothly, including the salaries of hirelings. If the property earns money that can offset maintenance costs (by charging fees, collecting tithes or donations, or selling goods), that is taken into account in the table.

**Skilled and Untrained Hirelings**. The *Player’s Handbook* explains the difference between a skilled hireling and an untrained one.

## Businesses
An adventurer-owned business can earn enough money to cover its own maintenance costs. However, the owner needs to periodically ensure that everything is running smoothly by tending to the business between adventures. ~~See the information on running a business in the “Downtime Activities” section of this chapter.~~

A character rolls a percentile dice and adds the number of days spent on his downtime activity (maximum 30), then compares the total to the **Running a Business* table to determine what happens.

If the character spends 1gp per day to promote the business add +1 (maximum 30) to the die roll.

If a character is required to pay a cost as a result of rolling on this table but fails to do so, the business begins to fail. For each unpaid debt incurred in this manner, the character takes a -10 penalty to subsequent rolls made on this table.

###### Running a Business
| 1d100 + days | Result |
| :---|---: |
| 01-20 | You must pay one and a half times the business's maintenance cost for each of the days. |
| 21-30 | You must pay the business's full maintenance cost for each of the days. |
| 31-40 | You must pay half the business's maintenance cost for each day. |
| 41-60 | The business covers its own maintenance cost for each of the days. |
| 61-80 | The business covers its own maintenance cost for each day. It earns a profit of 1d6 x 5 gp. |
| 81-90 | The business covers its own maintenance cost for each day. It earns a profit of 2d8 x 5 gp. |
| 91 or higher | The business covers its own maintenance cost for each day. It earns a profit of 3d10 x 5 gp. |

## Garrisons
Castles and keeps employ soldiers (use the veteran and guard statistics in the *Monster Manual*) to defend them. Roadside inns, outposts and forts, palaces, and temples rely on less-experienced defenders (use the guard statistics in the *Monster Manual*). These armed warriors make up the bulk of a property’s skilled hirelings.
