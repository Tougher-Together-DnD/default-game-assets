# Custom Crafting

## Rules for Crafting Magic Items

Creating a magic item is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.

***

### Requirements

> **Key Difference from DMG:**  
> Characters do **not** need to be spellcasters to create magic items. Material components and spell slots are not expended, except for spell scrolls. The magic of an item comes from the preparation fo the exotic material.

1. **Formula**  
   A *formula* or *blueprint* is required.
2. **Materials**  
   Exotic materials are necessary, often found through adventures in thematically appropriate locations (e.g., Yeti skin or water from the Elemental Plane of Water).
3. **Gold Cost and Time Required**  
   Costs and times differ from the DMG, as players gather materials by encountering creatures.
4. **Tools and Skills Proficiencies**  
   Appropriate proficiencies (e.g., Jeweler’s Tools, Arcana) are required.

### Crafting Table

| Item Rarity  | Material CR Range | Cost       | Workweeks  |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| Common       | 1–3               | 50 gp      | 1          |
| Uncommon     | 4–8               | 200 gp     | 2          |
| Rare         | 9–12              | 2,000 gp   | 10         |
| Very Rare    | 13–18             | 20,000 gp  | 25         |
| Legendary    | 19+               | 100,000 gp | 50         |

\* Consumable magic items (e.g., potions) halve the cost and time required.

### Crafting Challenges

Xanathar includes a table of potential complications:

| D6 Roll | Complication                                          |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | Rumors swirl that your work is unstable.              |
| 2       | Your tools are stolen, forcing you to buy new ones.   |
| 3       | A local wizard insists on observing your work.        |
| 4       | A noble demands your work for themselves.             |
| 5       | A dwarf clan accuses you of stealing its secrets.     |
| 6       | A competitor spreads rumors that your work is faulty. |

### Selling Magic Items

Finding a buyer for magic items can be challenging. Spreading the word costs **25 gp per workweek**, and only one item can be sold at a time. After finding a buyer, a **Charisma (Persuasion)** check determines the offer received.

| Rarity       | Roll 1–10   | Roll 11–20   | Roll 21+      |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Common       | 50 gp       | 100 gp       | 150 gp        |
| Uncommon     | 200 gp      | 400 gp       | 600 gp        |
| Rare         | 2,000 gp    | 4,000 gp     | 6,000 gp      |
| Very Rare    | 20,000 gp   | 40,000 gp    | 60,000 gp     |
| Legendary    | 100,000 gp  | 200,000 gp   | 300,000 gp    |

\* One-time-use items sell for half these values.

### Additional Considerations

- **Roleplaying Item Creation:** Incorporate challenges like incomplete formulas or emotional requirements.  
- **Unexpected Item Characteristics:** Items may gain perks, quirks, flaws or even curses based on tools or methods used during crafting.
